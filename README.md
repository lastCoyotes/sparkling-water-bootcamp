LambdaClass Sparkling Water Bootcamp 2023

As part of LambdaClasses 20-week internship, week by week schedule and resources found [here](https://github.com/lambdaclass/sparkling_water_bootcamp/tree/main).

This repository is a compilation of my exercises and challenges completed, organized by week.
I hope to implement additional Python implementations for the sake of teaching, but it will first be coded in Rust.
